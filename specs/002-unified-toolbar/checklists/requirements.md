# Specification Quality Checklist: 统一左侧工具栏容器

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All validation checks passed**

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (/speckit.clarify or /speckit.plan).

## Notes

- Specification focuses on UX improvement by consolidating four separate toolbars into a unified left-side container
- Mobile experience explicitly preserved to maintain existing optimizations
- All success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Edge cases identified for responsive behavior and keyboard shortcuts
